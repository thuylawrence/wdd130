      <h3>Memories</h3>
      <p>
        As time goes by, our lives get busier and busier. We slowly drift apart from each other. We don't get to see each other as often as we'd like. Some of us live overseas, some of us live in different states. Perhaps meeting each other once a year will be a perfect way for us to see each other, to hold each other, and to spend time together. It is a time for cousins to play games, to sing songs, to dance, and to enjoy each other's company. Let's make each of us feel that we belong to a loving and caring family.

      <p>
        Popular outdoor and indoor activities are available for all ages.
        Itinerary for our one week family reunion trip includes camping, hiking, fishing, and a talent show. 
        These activities will provide us with opportunities to enjoy nature, to exercise, to relax, and to enjoy each other's company.
