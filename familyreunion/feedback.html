          <p class="meditation">Yoga is an excelent exercise for all ages. Our hope is to include some yoga sessions during our reunion. This exercise is good for the mind and the body. During each yoga session, we will learn to clear our minds and be more present in the moment. We can recharge, refocus, and refresh before heading back to our daily life activities.</p>
